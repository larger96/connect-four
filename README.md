# Connect Four
An assignment for The Odin Project.

[Link](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/testing-your-ruby-code?ref=lnav) to the original assignment.

## Objective
The ain aim of this assignment was to create a command line version of the popular game, Connect Four. The main difference between this assignment and previous assignments was that this one was to be built in the Test Driven Development (TDD) style.

## What I Learned
My main take away from programming TDD style was that I was more focused on smaller chunks of code rather than the whole application as a whole. 

This allowed me to build my code up better stage by stage and resulted in fewer needs for bug fixes along the way.

## Command Line Output
```ruby
